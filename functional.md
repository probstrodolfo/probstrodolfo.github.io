### Research Overview

I love ants, if you haven't notice that already! And ant systematics plays a critical role in understanding the taxonomy, evolutionary relationships, and classification of those amazing organisms. One angle of my research emphasizes the diversity within their lineages, focusing on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic aspects. These elements are essential for comprehending the evolutionary adaptations that enable ants to be so abundant, diverse, and ecologically important.

In my work, I have revised the [taxonomy of different ant groups](https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5149.1.1), explored their [natural history](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279784021_Toward_understanding_the_predatory_ant_genus_Myopias_Formicidae_Ponerinae_including_a_key_to_global_species_male-based_generic_diagnosis_and_new_species_description)), and refined [biogeographical hypotheses](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/syen.12181) for how ant lineages moved around.

I am also passioanate about uncovering the evolutionary history of ants and their ecological roles. By combining [phylogenetics](https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/3/4/3/5545303) and [trait analyses](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/btp.13244), I have illuminated the dynamics of [morphological and ecological convergence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443185441000120?via%3Dihub).
