### Research Overview

One of my research interests focuses on the evolutionary ecology and molecular phylogenetics of ants, with a particular emphasis on ant-plant symbioses. Ants are key ecosystem players, and understanding their evolutionary and ecological roles sheds light on major topics of biology and evolution. My work has explored ant-plant relationships through a combination of **natural history**, **systematics**, and **cutting-edge molecular tools**.

I am studying ant-plant symbioses using the [***Myrmelachista***](https://www.antweb.org/images.do?genus=Myrmelachista) system as a model. This group of Neotropical ants involved in complex mutualisms with understory plants (mainly nesting inside species from the avocado family). My recent study, published in *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*, [revealed an extreme level of convergent evolution within ant-plant mutualisms](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.1214). I am currently expanding this project and including **whole-genome sequencing** to uncover the genomic foundations/signatures underlying convergent/parallel mechanisms of mutualisms in this group. I am also starting to explore how _Myrmelachista_ ant species adapt to environmental pressures, using **functional trait analyses** and long-term monitoring of their plant hosts.
