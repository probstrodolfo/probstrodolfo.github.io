**Statement on Commitment to Inclusive Excellence**

My commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is shaped by my experiences in STEM and my dedication to making science accessible to underrepresented communities. Throughout my career, I have actively promoted inclusive learning environments, mentored underrepresented students, and engaged in outreach that brings science to diverse audiences.

**Engaging Underrepresented Communities through Outreach**

A key part of my work has been outreach. As an organizer of public science events like BugFest at the NHMU, I help connect people with science through hands-on activities and educational talks. I’ve also led community science programs like BioBlitz, where participants learn about insect ecology, and DNA barcoding workshops that introduce scientific tools to the public. These efforts reflect my passion for making science accessible to all, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.

**Creating Inclusive Learning Spaces**

In my teaching, I prioritize creating spaces where students from all backgrounds feel valued. I co-taught a course exploring the intersection of identity and science, encouraging discussions on diversity, equity, and social justice. I’ve also designed field courses that expose students to real-world scientific challenges and use innovative tools, like DNA barcoding, to make complex concepts accessible. I aim to continue creating inclusive, hands-on learning environments.

**Mentoring and Empowering Underrepresented Students**

Mentorship is central to my work in DEI. I’ve mentored underrepresented students, helping them navigate academia and build confidence. I encourage students to take ownership of their learning and provide opportunities for them to present their research at diversity-focused conferences. My goal is to continue mentoring the next generation of scientists, offering research opportunities and fostering a culture of inclusivity and empowerment.
