### Research Overview

My research focuses on the evolutionary ecology and molecular phylogenetics of ants, with a particular emphasis on ant-plant symbioses. Ants are key ecosystem engineers, and understanding their evolutionary and ecological roles sheds light on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. My work has explored these relationships through a combination of **natural history**, **systematics**, and **cutting-edge molecular tools**.

A major focus of my research has been on the ***Myrmelachista*** system, a group of Neotropical ants involved in complex mutualisms with plants. My recent study, published in *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*, revealed convergent evolution within ant-plant mutualisms, showing how independent ant lineages evolved symbiotic relationships under similar environmental pressures. I am currently expanding this , including **whole-genome sequencing** to investigate the genomic foundations of these symbiotic systems. .

### Research Goals

In the short term, I aim to continue my work on ***Myrmelachista*** ant-plant mutualisms, utilizing **genomic tools** to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying these complex interactions. I will also explore how ant species adapt to environmental pressures, using **functional trait analyses** and **phylogenomic methods**.

Long-term, my goal is to develop a comprehensive **phylogenetic framework** for ants, contributing to broader ecological and evolutionary studies. This research will also inform conservation strategies for tropical ecosystems under threat from climate change and urbanization.

At my future academic institution, I plan on combining evolutionary biology with cutting-edge molecular approaches, creating a vibrant research program that fosters student involvement and advances our understanding of biodiversity.
