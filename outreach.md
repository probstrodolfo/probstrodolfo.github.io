### Outreach Initiatives

I am committed to advancing scientific literacy and making research accessible to broader communities through my outreach efforts. By combining my expertise in insects, ecology, and systematic phylogenetics, I engage with students, educators, and all kinds of public to foster curiosity and understanding of the natural world.
My outreach work focuses on breaking down barriers to scientific knowledge, inspiring curiosity, and empowering individuals to engage with and contribute to the world of science.

## Outreach Highlights

- **NHMU BugFest**: I actively participate in the **BugFest** hosted by the Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU). This event is a celebration of [our love for arthropods](https://nhmu.utah.edu/events/bugfest-2023-sunday/rodolfo-probst), where I help engage visitors of all ages in hands-on activities, [talks](https://bestlocalthings.com/ut/bugfest-2024-08-11-salt-lake-city), and exhibits. My work here involves sharing fascinating facts about insect biology, ecology, and their roles in ecosystems, aiming to ignite an interest in the natural world among the general public.

- **Workshops on Genomic Technologies**: I lead interactive workshops that introduce participants to [genetic tools such as DNA barcoding](https://nhmu.utah.edu/citizen-dna-barcode-network) and nanopore sequencing. These sessions are designed to be accessible for students and researchers of all levels, offering hands-on experience with sequencing technologies that are transforming biological research.

- **Public Science Talks and Seminars**: I have been invited to give talks at several institutions (including non-traditional teaching spaces, such as those involving incarcerated students), where I share my passion about entomology, ant-plant symbioses, biodiversity, and evolutionary biology. My presentations aim to make complex scientific concepts engaging and comprehensible for a wide audience.

- **Engaging with Citizen Science**: I participate in citizen science projects, particularly those focused on insect conservation. I encourage members of the public to contribute to scientific data collection, fostering a deeper connection between communities and the ecosystems they live in.
