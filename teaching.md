### Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on fostering a collaborative, inclusive, and student-focused environment that promotes inquiry, discovery, and active learning. I aim to blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical experience, connecting science to real-world challenges. My courses focus on building scientific literacy, critical thinking, and a deep passion for nature. Whether through discussions, immersive field experiences, or cutting-edge research tools, my goal is to engage students with dynamic, relevant content. 

I have designed and taught various courses across the U.S. and internationally, from molecular phylogenetics and evolutionary thinking to immersive ecology field courses. My teaching integrates modern research tools like nanopore sequencing, providing students with hands-on molecular biology experience that directly applies to real-world research. I envision bringing this approach to all academic spaces I participate, incorporating bioinformatics and phylogenetics into core courses, and designing electives that allow students to engage with nature appreciation.
