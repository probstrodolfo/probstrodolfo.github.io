### Research Overview

As a postdoctoral fellow in the Science Research Initiative (SRI) Program at the University of Utah, I have developed a nanopore sequencing pipeline that has been pivotal in multiple projects, including phylogenetic reconstructions, affordable molecular species identification, and biodiversity cataloguing. My students and  I have been successfully applying this pipeline in studies involving different taxa (i.e., mollusks, insects, spiders, birds). By leveraging this pipeline, my research has expanded the use of Nanopore sequencing as an educational tool, made me being selected by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) as a member of their Education Beta program.
