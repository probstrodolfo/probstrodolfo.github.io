### Successful presentations at the 2024 SACNAS NDiSTEM Conference!
Congratulations to Sara, Ainsley, Alex, Kyle, Megan, and Sylvia on presenting their posters at the [SACNAS NDiSTEM](https://www.sacnas.org/conference) conference in Phoenix! What a great opportunity for each of them to share their work with a broader audience, engage in discussions, and gain valuable feedback. Iâ€™m proud of their hard work and dedication - exciting to see them represent our research so well!

### Congratulations to Our 2024 UROP and Wilkes Scholar Awardees!

---

#### Sylvia Lee
*Project*: **Unraveling the Identities of Associated Insects in Ant-Plant Symbioses with Nanopore DNA Sequencing**  
Sylvia was awarded a UROP grant to explore insect diversity within ant-plant symbioses using cutting-edge nanopore sequencing technology. Way to go, Sylvia!

#### Will Pearce
*Project*: **DNA Barcoding to Solve Species Boundaries: Discovering Endemic _Ocotea_ (Lauraceae) in Costa Rica**  
Will received a UROP award for his project researching how DNA barcoding can help us uncover species boundaries within the aguacatillo genus _Ocotea_ in Costa Rica. Great job, Will!

#### Alexander Rich
*Project*: **Decoding Spider Diversity: Venom RNA and Protein Peptide Analysis**  
Alexander was honored with a UROP award for his groundbreaking research analyzing spider venom RNA to uncover spider diversity. Impressive, Alex!

#### Ainsley Parkins (Wilkes Scholar Awardee)
*Project*: **Unveiling Cryptic Avifauna Diversity Using Nanopore DNA Sequencing: A Case Study in the Passerine Genus *Emberiza* (Passeriformes: Emberizidae)**  
Ainsley, a Wilkes Scholar, is investigating cryptic bird diversity using nanopore sequencing, with a focus on the *Emberiza* genus. Congratulations, Ainsley!

#### Megan Duval (Co-Mentor: Dr. Rodolfo Probst, Mentor: Dr. Jack Longino)
*Project*: **Exploring Species Boundaries in *Labidus*, a Widespread Army Ant Genus**  
Megan, with guidance from both Jack Longino and myself, was awarded a renewal for her UROP project investigating species boundaries within the army ant genus _Labidus_. Megan just submitted a paper to _Insect Systematics & Diversity_ (what!) product of her research! Hooray!
