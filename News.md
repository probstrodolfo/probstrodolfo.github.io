### January 2025
#### _More presentations from our group!_
Kyle Cink got selected to present his research on nanopore sequencing of SE Asian micromollusks at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR) this April in Pittsburgh! Hooray! And Megan DuVal and Sylvia Lee were both selected to present oral talks at the Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America this coming March in Salt Lake City! 

Our lab were a full steam during the [STEMFEST at Eastwood Elementary](https://schools.graniteschools.org/eastwood/2025/01/15/stemfest/). What a great time interacting with students and their families while talking bugs, mollusks, birds, and DNA!

#### Sylvia Lee
*Project*: **Unraveling the Identities of Associated Insects in Ant-Plant Symbioses with Nanopore DNA Sequencing**  
Sylvia was awarded a UROP grant to explore insect diversity within ant-plant symbioses using cutting-edge nanopore sequencing technology. Way to go, Sylvia!

#### Will Pearce
*Project*: **DNA Barcoding to Solve Species Boundaries: Discovering Endemic _Ocotea_ (Lauraceae) in Costa Rica**  
Will received a UROP award for his project researching how DNA barcoding can help us uncover species boundaries within the aguacatillo genus _Ocotea_ in Costa Rica. Great job, Will!

#### Alexander Rich
*Project*: **Decoding Spider Diversity: Venom RNA and Protein Peptide Analysis**  
Alexander was honored with a UROP award for his groundbreaking research analyzing spider venom RNA to uncover spider diversity. Impressive, Alex!
