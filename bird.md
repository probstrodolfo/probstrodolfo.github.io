title: "Cryptic Avian Diversity"
---
### Research Overview

Cryptic species pose a unique challenge in biological research, as they are often morphologically indistinguishable but genetically distinct. In collaboration with the Şekercioğlu Lab (https://faculty.utah.edu/u0698676-CAGAN_H_SEKERCIOGLU/hm/index.hml), we have been exploring cryptic avian diversity combining DNA barcoding, multitrait analyses, and ecological modeling to reveal hidden bird species and unravel their ecological roles.

Through DNA barcoding, using markers such as the COI gene, we have been able to identify cryptic species within different passerine genera, offering new insights into species distributions and behaviors. Integrating this molecular approach with ecological niche modeling will allow us to predict how these cryptic species are distributed across different environments, which is crucial for biodiversity conservation.

Along with my students, we have been incorporating next-generation sequencing (NGS) in real-timme with portable Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) instruments, further refinining species delimitation processes. Coupling these methods with niche modeling will enable predictions about the future distributions of these cryptic species under various climate change scenarios, thus enhancing conservation strategies by pinpointing regions of high cryptic avian diversity that may be at risk.
